Project 3 - Juno Bootcamp - Solo interactive jQuery site
created by Oksana Samokhvalova
A game with a coding cat going through the bootcamp that can be helped/manipulated by pressing respective buttons.
MVP (Minimal Viable Product)Goals
1. Landing page to welcome the user to the site and explain how to help the coding cat and the start button.
2. Game page showing the cat itself (animated, typing on the keyboard), the timer, a window with current energy level the text field with hints for the user, and the button which updates the energy level. The timer starts running once the user comes to the game page.
3. The energy level is automatically depleting every 5 seconds, the text field with hints is updating based on the energy level, so the user is hinted to press the button to increase the energy level.
Stretch Goals
1. Create additional properties on the cat object, e.g. hunger level.
2. Create additional buttons which will be updating the added properties, e.g. sleep, feed.
3. Decreasing and increasing the animation speed based on the energy level of the cat.
